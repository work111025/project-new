## 1. Input Collection and Normalization  
- Normalize characters by trimming extra spaces and standardizing punctuation and casing.

## 2. Option Segmentation and Labeling  
- Split the content into individual choices.  
- Assign a consistent identifier to each choice (e.g., Choice 1, Choice 2, etc.).

## 3. Grammar and Syntax Analysis  
- Break each option into syntactic components (subject, predicate, objects, modifiers).  
- Verify correct use of function words (particles, conjunctions) and verb endings or inflections according to the target language’s rules.  
- Flag any option with missing or misplaced elements.

## 4. Vocabulary and Collocation Check  
- Identify key words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) and validate them against a trusted dictionary or lexicon.  
- Ensure idiomatic expressions and collocations are natural for the language.  
- Mark any neologisms or nonstandard tokens.

## 5. Semantic and Logical Coherence  
- Interpret the overall meaning of each option.  
- Discard any that convey illogical or contradictory scenarios.  
- Confirm that the intended message is clear and contextually appropriate.

## 6. Elimination and Narrowing  
- Remove options with major grammatical errors or nonsensical content.  
- Discard ambiguous or redundant choices.  
- Retain only those that fully comply with grammar and semantics.

## 7. Final Selection  
- From the remaining options, pick the one that is most natural and commonly used in real-world language.  
- Perform a last check to ensure no subtle mistakes remain.

## 8. Output Formatting  
- Return the identifier of the chosen answer.  
- Provide a concise explanation highlighting the key reason(s) for the choice (e.g., “Correct particle usage,” “Logical meaning”).
